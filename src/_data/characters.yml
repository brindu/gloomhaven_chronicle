  story: |
    _Filthy rat!_ Filfy lost count how many times he heard some weak minded
    creature refer to him that way. Well, hearing... You don't need to hear
    anything when your mind is strong. And Filfy's mind is strong. The many
    years in the sewers of Gloomhaven were horrible at first, so many rats,
    so many voices his own head almost exploded. But Filthy reversed this
    tendancy and fully mastered his psychic abilities for other's head to
    explode. The mind holds no secrets for him no more. But the body is weak
    too, and Filfy will discover all the physical weaknesses as well. He is
    Filfy The Rat, easy name to remember for the weak minded, and he is back
    in the outer world.

  story: |
    The birth of Bzzzzzz! was heralded by good omens in the sky: the sun dimmed
    a little, the rainbows were never full, and the Great Eclipse of 4156 was
    obscured by clouds so thick nobody could see a thing. So when Bzzzzz! was
    finally born, great things were expected of him, and it was to the great
    disappointment of his kin that not much has actually proceeded to happen.
    The clouds kept moving. The sun kept on doing its thing. Even the number of
    ants hasn’t grown. Quickly, Bzzzzzz! has gotten used to being treated like
    the black sheep of the family. He couldn’t compare to his older brother Cholera
    or his sister Malaria. He was altogether different, and his particular passion
    for a little fashion didn’t make things easier. But he kept dreaming - he kept
    dreaming that just maybe one day he is going to surprise them all. He knew that
    in order to do that he had to venture out into the wider world, and the city
    of Gloomhaven seemed like the perfect starting point. The people he met there:
    the sneaky vermling, the slightly suspicious chef, and the barrel-obsessed rock
    lady - weren’t the friends of his dreams, but offered him a ticket to achieving
    his new life goal. And he could finally get a new cloak or two, too.

  story: |
    -TANTRARUM! - the roar spread across the sea and caught up with the ship leaving
    the island. Leaf Cliff The Tree barely turned their head towards the sound,
    arriving in bliss and nirvana. In the dungeon drenched in blood, with dozens of
    bodies of vermlings, T'Ar stood there in rage and euphoria. Someone has already
    dealt with all the vermlings and taken all the gold. Someone with lust for blood
    and gold just as big as hers. She had to find out who those tireless heroes were
    and join them no matter what.
    Despite the fact that T'Ar was born in an Inox tribe and despite her berserk
    nature, she always strived for knowledge and by the age of only 30 years she
    could already read simple sentences if spoken out loud. She was able to even write
    her name! Although sometimes, in a fit of rage or simply due to a hot temperament,
    all manuscripts and textbooks were destroyed and she had to start all over.
    Diplomacy skills were also not lacking, slightly more developed than in other
    berserkers, so she was able to establish contact with the Croaky's Waste Management
    Services and join them, hoping that she could both see the world and quench her
    insatiable thirst for blood.
    Would she find there more - maybe friends? Someone to take care of and to sacrifice
    herself for over and over again...
