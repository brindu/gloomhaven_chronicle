Without Bamboo Bandit, Croaky's Waste Management Services felt a bit hollow. To
pass the time and fill the void, they indulged in the vibrant escape of a music
concert, letting melody and rhythm wash over them. The performance was so
captivating that it dulled their usually sharp senses to the unsavory dealings
happening just out of sight.

Seeking further distraction, they decided upon a grim taskâ€”zombie hunting. There
was, after all, a crypt still writhing with the undead, a place strangely dear
to
the cultists. On the path there, they crossed a city guard, injured and
desperate
for aid. Leaf Cliff, ever the gentle giant, offered a healing potion, brightly
displaying the kind of hero she was.

The crypt welcomed them with its chilling embrace, a dance floor for the macabre
ritual they'd rehearsed so many times. Undead after undead fell to their
relentless
onslaught. Yet, amidst the decay and shadow, they encountered another
necromancer,
a figure whose power was almost palpable in the chilling air of the crypt.

This necromancer bore a deep resentment for Jekserah, an enmity fierce enough to
offer an alliance against her. His proposition was clear: unite against the
mutual
enemy, despite the darkness that clung to him like a shroud.

Faced with this dark offer, Croaky's Waste Management Services stood at a
crossroad.
Would they accept the help of one evil to defeat another, or stand by their
principles,
facing whatever challenges that might mean on their own? The echoes of last
night's
music were a stark contrast to the silence that now fell upon them as they
pondered
their next move.
