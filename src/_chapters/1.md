title: The Dice and the Deal

The Sleeping Lion inn, a haven for weary travelers and the hopeful alike, buzzed
with the energy of tales untold. In its warm embrace, four adventurers, known
collectively as Croaky's Waste Management Services, found themselves seated
around a crackling fire. Filthy the Rat, with thoughts as mysterious as the
nights of Gloomhaven; Bamboo Bandit, as swift and unpredictable as a gust of
wind; Violet Vajazzle, whose magical prowess was as vibrant as the evening sky;
and Leaf Cliff, steadfast as the ancient oaks, shared a moment of camaraderie.

Their gathering was interrupted by the roll of bone dice, an invitation to
fortune by a man whose trustworthiness was as absent as the light in his eyes.
Tempted by the thrill of chance, the party played and watched their gold
disappear into the man's growing pile. Their misfortune was a harsh lesson
learned, and their purses felt all too light.

Yet the night still held promise, for at the Sleeping Lion, they crossed paths
with Jekserah, a Valrath merchant clad in the rich tapestries of commerce and
intrigue. Her request was simple: retrieve important documents stolen by a wily
thief, documents that had found their way to the dangerous lair known as Black
Barrow. The reward was enticing, and it promised to replenish the gold they had
lost.

With the taste of adventure on their tongues, they stepped into the chill of the
night. Guided by moonlight, they met a caravan of Inox burdened with worldly
possessions. Seeing themselves in the eyes of these travelers, Croaky's Waste
Management Services offered their help. Together, they shared the weight and the
winding road.

A wise Inox shaman, old and bent but with a kind spark in her eyes, saw their
good hearts. In thanks, she shared a secret, a special place called the "Burning
Mountain." She spoke words that were as old as the hills, and with them, a new
adventure was born.

Onward to Black Barrow, the four friends journeyed, hearts heavy with the weight
of their new taskâ€”yet hopeful for redemption. Inside the gloomy barrow, they
clashed with bandits and their vile undead minions, a horde of living bones that
defied the natural order. The battle was fierce, and despite their bravery,
Croaky's Waste Management Services were bested, their quest unfinished.

They lay on the cold ground of Black Barrow, not as failures, but as heroes who
had given their all. The story of their fight would not end here; in Gloomhaven,
even the end is just another beginning.

As the stars wheeled overhead, the memory of Croaky's Waste Management
Services lingered in the air, a promise that Filthy the Rat, Bamboo Bandit,
Violet Vajazzle, and Leaf Cliff would rise again. The call of adventure was far
from over, and the whispers of the night spoke of their imminent return to the
twisted pathways and hidden secrets of Gloomhaven.
