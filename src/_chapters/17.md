title: Culinary Consolation and the Warden's Task
---

With their ranks thinned, Filthy the Rat and Leaf Cleaf
found their daily morale only lifted by the culinary delights of Chef Lovebone.
Once a Sawbone serving the Great Oak, the human had traded his scalpel for a chef's knife,
keen on pursuing his true culinary calling. His food was a comfort, rich and full of life,
a stark contrast to their battles against the undead.

As if summoned by the scents wafting from Lovebone's kitchen, Bamboo Bandit reappeared,
drawn back to the fold. Her return signaled the reformation of the party, despite the
lingering absence of Violet. But time had not quelled her obsession with Xorn; it was
she who urged them onward, towards the Crypt Basement and the mysteries it hid.

Leaving the culinary refuge of Gloomhaven behind, they set out on their quest, only to
stumble upon Violet Vajazzle en route. She had not traveled far before encountering demons
spilled forth from a Demonic Rift. Together, the party dispatched the fiends in a nostalgic
reminder of past camaraderie. Violet invited them to join her later at the rift's location,
but duty called them elsewhereâ€”to the Crypt of the Damned.

The adventurers uncovered the secret passage leading down into the crypt's depths where a
foul miasma permeated the air. In the bowels of the crypt, they discovered a forge of
unearthly design, around which an otherworldly specter coalesced. He introduced himself as
the warden of this forsaken place, charged with the reformation of Zorn's staff.

As the warden began his ancient work, the restless dead surged with a renewed ferocity,
intent on halting the restoration of Xorn's might. The party's defense, though valiant,
faltered under the onslaught. But Leaf Cleaf, with a sorcerer's focus, summoned a barrier
of rock and earth, offering a respite against the relentless tide of abominations.

The staff, now whole once more, pulsed with an energy that swept through the chamber and
reduced the undead to silent ash. The warden, his task complete, entrusted the reformed
staff to Bamboo Bandit and bestowed upon them a grave charge: to carry it to the Palace
of Ice and break the seals of Xorn's ancient tomb.

With the staff in hand, and a new quest laid before them, Croaky's Waste Management
Services, now accompanied by the culinary Sawbone turned Chef Lovebone, faced the icy
road ahead, uncertain of what would greet them at the journey's end.
