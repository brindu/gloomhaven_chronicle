title: The Vermling's Dupe and Weighty Choices
---

In the bustling Gloomhaven market, where deals are made and fortunes turn with
the wind, Croaky's Waste Management Services found themselves ensnared by the
guile of a Vermling merchant. This humanoid rodent, all smiles and oily charm,
peddled a shiny bauble, claiming it was a relic of untold power. Alas, what
glittered was not gold, but a trinket no more magical than a rock—except perhaps
heavier and far less useful.

Despite the sting of deceit, the party had a task at hand—Jekserah's bloody
request to lay low the Inox responsible for her caravan woes. With heavy hearts,
they tread the path to Inox lands. It was Leaf Cliff who, in a display of might
and mastery over stone, averted disaster as a landslide threatened their
passage. His kinship with the earth moved rock and rubble, clearing the way
forward.

The Inox campsite, once found, became a sorrowful tableau; the air grew thick
with the grim resolve of duty conflicting with conscience. Croaky's Waste
Management Services did what was asked of them—but at a cost far greater than
they had anticipated. Steel and spell did not discriminate in the chaos of
melee, and when the dust settled, all lay silent. The outcome was a massacre;
one that would haunt them, for among the fallen were the young—a detail that
could not be brushed aside like so much dust on a mantle.

With the deed done, they returned to Jekserah. Her manor exuded opulence, a
stark contrast to the scenes of violence they'd left behind. Cold coins filled
their palms, a reward that felt heavier than usual. Her eyes, sharp as the
daggers she sold, revealed her next desire: a diamond, grand in size, from the
depths of the Diamond Mine.

Yet the course of their fates shifted once more, as they stepped from the dim of
Jekserah's schemes into the light of day. Argeise, a city guard draped in the
duty of his station, approached them with a whisper of treason. Jekserah's
ambitions, it seemed, reached further than commerce; she sought to unsettle the
very balance of power in Gloomhaven itself.

Argeise presented them with an alternative—to aid the city they had come to
know, to peel back the curtain on Jekserah's darkened stage. A new mission took
shape, an opportunity to do more than amass wealth. It was a chance to protect
the heartbeat of Gloomhaven, to stand for something greater than their own
interests.

For Croaky's Waste Management Services, the road they walked had never felt so
fraught with consequence. Each step was a choice, and each choice a reflection
of the legacy they would one day leave behind.
