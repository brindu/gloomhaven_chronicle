The taste of defeat was still fresh as Croaky's Waste Management Services,
accompanied once more by Hail the Enchanter, returned to the Forgotten Crypt.
Leaf Cliff's grounding presence bolstered their ranks, even as Bamboo Bandit's
absence left a gap in their formation. The night before had seen them drown
their sorrows at the Sleeping Lion, a session of liquid consolation that led
to an unlikely discovery in Gloomhaven's underbellyâ€”weapons and materials
they dutifully returned to the city guard.

As they ventured through the wilderness towards the crypt, nature herself
seemed to be in turmoil. A rush of rats, squirrels, and other woodland
creatures scurried past, fleeing the lick of flames that threatened to
consume the forest. Violet Vajazzle, ever confident in her elemental
command, assured them they could navigate the inferno. Her optimism was
misplaced, and by the time they reached the crypt, their clothes were
singed, their skin seared by the heat.

Inside the crypt, familiarity bred contempt for the dead that rose to
challenge them. The crypt's maze of darkness was now a battlefield where
the dead clawed their way back with increasing fervor. Croaky's Waste
Management Services pushed forward, carving a path through bone and decay,
the weight of endless resurgence on their heels.

In the heart of the crypt lay a chamber gleaming with gold, an opulent
horde that beckoned even as Hail moved with purpose toward the censer.
Their greed took hold, and they deliberately delayed her progress, holding
back the enchanter as they filled their pockets with the spoils, despite
the pressing danger and Hail's growing frustration.

Finally, with bags swollen with loot and Hail at the censer, a few murmured
words of power sufficed to still the tide of undeath, reducing the risen
to dust and silence.

With the censer in their possession and their pockets heavy with treasure,
it seemed they stood ready to seal the rift at last. Hail, her demeanor
fraught with the urgency of their task, could only hope that their
avaricious delay had not cost them more than they knew. Now, the rift
awaited, a wound in the world that called for their hard-won prize, and
for the courage to face what lay beyond.
