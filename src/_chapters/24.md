The subterranean allure pulls Croaky's Waste Management Services ever deeper into
the mountain's bowels. A whispering voice in their minds promises guidance and
speaks of its own entrapment. Skepticism gnaws at them, even as they press on,
drawn by curiosity and the magnetic pull of the unknown.

The voice, like a specter in their consciousness, paints a vivid tapestry of
its plight. It was bound beneath the earth by forces unseen, for reasons untold.
Silence falls over the party as the voice withdraws temporarily, leaving them
adrift in cavernous darkness, their only companion the sound of their breaths.

Yet, just as doubt begins to fester, the voice returns, now fraught with urgency.
It speaks of guardians, monstrous denizens that stand sentinel over its ethereal
prison. It devises a plan—open the doors to its chamber to allow its essence to
resonate freely once more.

However, the task is far from trivial. The chamber brims with drakes and Oozes,
the latter a grotesque, amorphous threat that splits and multiplies under their
blows. Undeterred by the challenge, the party sets to work, cleaving through scales
and gelatinous flesh.

Despite the relentless tide of Oozes, the final door swings open on creaking hinges.
A wind stirs from stillness to maelstrom in an instant; the voice, now a mighty roar,
eradicates the remaining monsters in an arcane outburst. Although the voice remains
bound, it gains a semblance of strength, yet its full freedom eludes it still.

Reassurances flow from the voice, disavowing any intent to usher in disaster upon
the world. It imparts knowledge of its first vessel of power—a key to loosening its
chains. Gratitude manifests in the form of guidance, leading the party from the
labyrinthine depths back towards the surface.

With wary minds, Croaky's Waste Management Services emerges into the light, the voice's
vessel their next objective. Yet, a seed of doubt takes root among them: should they
first uncover the truth of this entity's imprisonment, before setting it free?
