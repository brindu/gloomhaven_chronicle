title: Diplomatic Endeavors and the Sealing of the Rift
---

Bamboo Bandit's absence was felt yet again by Croaky's Waste Management
Services—her
disappearances becoming as much a part of the routine as the morning mists over
Gloomhaven. Amidst the comings and goings, the city found itself host to an
unusual
delegation: Lurkers from the sea's depths emerged, clicking and clapping their
pincer-claws in an attempt at communication.

The adventurers, ever the heroes, endeavored to decipher the Lurkers' cryptic
language.
Despite their efforts, understanding eluded them, and the crab-like beings
departed as
mysteriously as they had arrived, leaving behind a trail of frustration. The
city, nonetheless,
commended the party for their attempt at peaceful engagement.

Yet there remained the pressing matter of a rift that needed closing, and Hail
was once
again at their side as they set off for the crypt. Prepared for the onslaught
they knew
would come, they stood ready, a barrier between Hail and the inevitable demonic
horde.

As the elemental demons sprang forth from every direction, the party executed a
flawless
defense, dispatching the demons before they could even fully manifest. There was
an
unstoppable rhythm to their fight, a dance of destruction performed with such
efficiency
that Leaf Cliff found himself with nary a demon within reach to engage.

At the culmination of their vigil, Hail withdrew her arm from the rift, her
expression
etched with both exhaustion and triumph. A gale-force wind arose, howling with
the
sound of a world correcting itself. The remaining elemental demons were swept
back
through the collapsing rift, dragged to their own plane.

As the last vestiges of the rift vanished, Croaky's Waste Management Services
stood in
the silent crypt, the threat finally vanquished. They had sealed the rift,
restoring
balance in a moment that would be etched into the annals of Gloomhaven's
history—the
day the adventurers closed the tear in the fabric of the world.
