title: Rift Reckoning and the Elemental Onslaught
---

Rejoicing in the return of Bamboo Bandit, Croaky's Waste Management Services
found their ranks whole once more. Their deeds had not gone unnoticed in
Gloomhaven; wealthy merchants beckoned them to a wedding festivities,
where their thoughtful gift was met with hearty approval. Yet, such social
splendors were but a brief diversion from their true calling.

The journey to the crypt, once fraught with peril, was quietly dead this time.
The crypt itself, usually a cesspool of darkness and
malevolence, stood eerily empty, save for the massive rift that loomed like a
wound in the fabric of reality over the demonic altar.

Hail, with the elemental censer in hand, stepped forward with determination.
Inserting her arm into the rift, she began the intricate process of closing
it. As she did, elemental demons emerged at the room's corners, drawn to the
disruption of their domain.

The battle was fierce—Croaky's Waste Management Services fought with a fury
born of desperation, defending Hail against the relentless wave of elemental
foes. The enchanter worked tirelessly, her form a beacon of concentration
amidst the chaos of battle.

But time wore on, and as Hail continued her work, the intensity of the assault
escalated. Then, in a heart-stopping moment, an elemental demon slipped through
just a single breach in the party's defense and struck Hail with a devastating
blow.

With the enchanter incapacitated, the ritual halted, and the rift remained
agape—their mission in tatters. The crypt was silent once more, save for the
whispers of the unforgiving rift and the heavy breaths of weary adventurers
facing an uncertain future.
