Violet Vajazzle sought the sweet solace of rest, leaving Croaky's Waste
Management Services a trio for the day's trials. Before embarking on their
mission to thwart the dark endeavors of cultists and necromancers in the Ruinous
Crypt, duty—and a touch of soft-heartedness—called them to a seemingly minor yet
noble task. Amidst the silence of Gloomhaven's abandoned byways, a cry for help
echoed from a cat stranded in an old, forsaken building. With careful hands and
warm hearts, the adventurers rescued the stranded feline, their simple act of
kindness a beacon of hope for the townsfolk who witnessed it.

The path that would lead them to the Ruinous Crypt was to test their capacity
for compassion once more. A defenseless puppy, its eyes brimming with both fear
and trust, crossed their way. Leaf Cliff, the sturdiest among them, could not
leave the creature to fend for itself in the wilds. With a resolve as enduring
as the mountains he emulated, Leaf Cliff gathered the tiny being into his arms,
ready to protect it as fiercely as he would any comrade in arms.

With their unexpected charge in tow, Croaky's Waste Management Services delved
into the crypt's chilling embrace. The air was thick with the scent of ancient
incense and the resonant chants of cultists, whose unholy intonations tore a
rift through the planes, calling forth horrors from beyond. The battle that
followed was a cumbersome ballet. Leaf Cliff, cradling the puppy against his
rocky chest, fought with a singular, if awkward, grace. Each swing of his arm
and step of his heavy boots was measured, ensuring the safety of the innocent
life nestled close while dealing retribution to their foes.

Cultists fell before their might, their dark ceremony interrupted by sword and
stone, yet the aftermath presented a new quandary. Before them lingered the
rift, closed enough to prevent further horrors from entering their world, yet
still a gaping wound in the realm's fabric.

With the crypt now silent, save for the rasping breaths of worn but victorious
warriors, the adventurers faced a poignant decision. Dare the mysterious rift,
an action as reckless as it was brave, or return to the cobblestone streets of
Gloomhaven to consult an enchanter, one perhaps knowledgeable in the eldritch
forces at play?

Humor tinged their counsel, for they were still full from their pie conquest,
and now Leaf Cliff, the mighty Cragheart, had proven himself capable of battling
with a babe—a pup, in this case—in arms. No matter the choice, the story of
Croaky's Waste Management Services would continue, woven with threads of
courage, whimsy, and an ever-growing bond that extended even to the smallest of
creatures.
