title: Betrayal's Lair and the Pursuit of Shadows
---

The whispers of conspiracy that had been sown by Argeise, the vigilant
city guard, bloomed within the minds of Croaky's Waste Management
Services. The moon hung like a silent judge in the sky as they made
their way to the warehouse, a shadow within Gloomhaven's sleeping streets.

Anticipation coursed through their veins, for within the walls of the
unassuming structure lay the crux of Jekserah's treachery. The warehouse,
which should have stood empty and silent, was instead a cavern of macabre
animation. Skeletons and reanimated corpses, products of necromancy most
foul, roamed with the hollow purpose bestowed by dark enchantments. The
very air crackled with the perversion of life.

With steel and spell, the party set upon the undead. They were a whirlwind,
their movements a symphony of destruction that rendered bone and sinew
asunder. The hollowed minions of Jekserah fell once more into silence,
their brief animation snuffed like candles in the wind.

There, amidst the chaos and crates of the warehouse's depths, they
confronted Jekserah. The Valrath, her eyes alight with the fires of
ambition and escape, hissed promises of retribution and conquest as she
made her hasty retreat through a window, the night swallowing her form.

Her escape was not to be an easy one, for two Inox bodyguards, giants in
stature and menace, stood between the adventurers and their quarry. Yet
their size was no match for the righteous fury of the party. Mighty Leaf
Cliff, Filthy the Rat, Bamboo Bandit, and Violet Vajazzle fought with valor,
their pride swelling with each landed blow until the behemoths lay defeated
at their feet.

With the warehouse cleared and the truth of Jekserah's vile intent laid bare,
they knew their task was far from complete. The necromancer's threat loomed
over Gloomhaven like a storm cloud, her escape a harbinger of darkness to
come. To allow her free reign was to permit the shadows to fester and grow.

They would need guidance, a means to track down the elusive Valrath and put
a definitive end to her dark aspirations. Hail, the enigmatic enchanter, once
more held the key. With her knowledge of the arcane and otherworldly, she alone
could illuminate the path to Jekserah's hiding place. Croaky's Waste Management
Services braced themselves for the next leg of the hunt, their resolve as
unyielding as the stone walls that protected the city they now sought to save.
