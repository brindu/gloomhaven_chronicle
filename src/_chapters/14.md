title: Vermling Onslaught and the Legacy of Xorn
---

Gloomhaven's day of bustling activity took a sharp turn as Vermlings, those
rat-like humanoids with mischief in their hearts, launched an assault on the
city. But they hadn't counted on encountering Croaky's Waste Management
Services atop the city walls. The resulting skirmish was brief and brutalâ€”the
Vermlings stood little chance against the well-honed prowess of the party.

In the aftermath of the battle, Bamboo Bandit's mind was elsewhere, her focus
set on a quest of her own. Muttering about the remains of "Xorn," she revealed
an ancient tome to her companions. Within its worn pages lay the directions to
a hidden passage, concealed within an old, forgotten shack in the Sinking
Market.

The party's search was meticulous, and their efforts were rewarded as they found
the clever mechanism. With a rumble of ancient gears, the floor yielded, opening
the way to a staircase spiraling into the depths below. There was no hesitation
as
they descended, but fate, it seemed, had other plans. The way behind them
vanished,
and a rain of stones barricaded each member from the others. Solitude would be
their
trial this time.

Bamboo Bandit, undeterred and ever resourceful, navigated her isolated path
until she
stumbled upon a chest. It held fragments of a grimy staff, and tucked beside it,
a set
of instructions pointing to a secret chamber in a crypt they had previously
explored.
Though the staff's purpose was a mystery, she knew it was a key to something
greater.

As Bamboo Bandit secured the final piece, the sound of grinding stone revealed
hidden
doors swinging open, a passage reuniting her with her fellow adventurers. Each
had
survived their own gauntlet and now stood together once more. With the staff in
hand,
and the instructions pointing them back to familiar shadows, the crypt awaited
their
return, promising answers hidden within its ancient, echoing halls.
