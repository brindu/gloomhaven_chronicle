title: The Seer's Bargain
---

With the grim events at the Palace of Ice behind them and the mysterious
Plagueherald
named Bzzzz! now in their ranks, Croaky's Waste Management Services sought
answers to
their many questions. Their search led them to the Temple of the Seer, a sacred
site
where the Great Oak's followers journeyed in search of enlightenmentâ€”and where
many
perished trying.

The path to the temple, situated amid the treacherous heights of the Watcher
Mountains,
was fraught with danger. The climb tested their resolve, as winds howled like
living
things and loose stones betrayed their footing. Yet, they persevered, driven by
a need
for understanding that outweighed the risk.

Upon their arrival in the temple's grand foyer, their presence was met with
abrupt
dismissal. "I cannot accept visitors now, go away and come back in 12 years,"
declared
a voice lacking form but full of authority. As if to enforce this edict, stone
golems,
bears, and drakes materialized to block their passage.

The party, no strangers to the language of violence, answered this challenge
head-on.
Their blades and spells cut a swath through their assailants, Bzzzz! proving his
toxic
prowess alongside them. With each creature felled, their determination only
grew; they
would not be denied the answers they so desperately sought.

The unseen voice, now perhaps recognizing the group's indomitable will, proposed
a
compromise. With a reluctant tone, it agreed to answer a single query from the
weary
travelers.

Strangely, the heat of battle seemed to unify their thoughts, for when the
moment came
to pose their question, their minds echoed a shared ambition: they yearned for
immeasurable wealth. The Seer's voice, taking on a hint of amusement, directed
them to
the Lost Island, a place shrouded in legend and rich with hidden bounty.

With a singular goal now illuminating their path, Croaky's Waste Management
Services
departed the temple, the quest for riches kindling a new flame within their
hearts.
The promise of the Lost Island awaited.
