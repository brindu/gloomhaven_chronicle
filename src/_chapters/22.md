The reduced ranks of Croaky's Waste Management Services, now a trio grappling with the
departure of their comrade Leaf Cleaf, turned their focus to a familiar task—sealing
a breach in the fabric of reality. Perhaps, in mending this tear, they could find some
solace for the void left within their ranks.

Fate saw them reunited with Violet Vajazzle, the Orchid who had once traveled alongside
them. She beckoned them to aid in closing the Demonic Rift, a task that had claimed much
of her time as other rifts had sprung forth across the land. Now, she stood amidst a field,
awaiting their arrival to confront this latest threat.

Violet explained the perilous plan: she required a defense on the other side of the rift,
so she could focus on the intricate rituals needed to seal it. Without hesitation, Filthy
and Bzzzzz! stepped through the rift into the elemental plane, their blades and poisons
ready to meet the demonic onslaught.

In the realm of swirling energies and hostile entities, the Vermling and the Plagueherald
fought fiercely, a whirl of death laying low the demonic defenders. Meanwhile, Bzzzzz!,
ever the opportunist, seized the chance to snatch up elemental artifacts—treasures of a
plane beyond their own.

Back on the material side, Violet's incantations reached a crescendo, and with a final,
definitive command, the rift obeyed her will, sealing shut with a ripple of displaced
power. The shockwave flung Filthy and Bzzzzz! back to their home plane, the mission
accomplished amid the quiet of the once-disrupted field.

Success was theirs, but the scars of their losses remained, a reminder that in closing
one rift, they could not mend all fractures. Nonetheless, Croaky's Waste Management
Services had once more averted a crisis, adding another victory to their storied legacy.
