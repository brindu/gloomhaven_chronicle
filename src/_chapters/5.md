title: Pie Victors and Cryptic Gluttons
---

The sun dawned on Gloomhaven's market, where a spectacle of indulgence awaited.
Croaky's Waste Management Services, still giddy from their encounter with the
chef's peculiar fare, found themselves lured by the siren call of a pie-eating
contest. Fresh from their alchemical-tasting victory, they approached the table
where flaky crusts and fruity fillings beckoned like treasure chests begging to
be plundered.

The competition? A boisterous crew of sailors with stomachs as deep as the
ocean. The pies disappeared at an impressive rate, but the joy of eating faded
into the realm of legend, replaced by the steely glare of determination. The
party's will to win surged, driving them to new heights of culinary conquest.
They ate, and ate, and then ate some more, long past the point of comfort, into
a world of gut-busting torment. But in the end, victory was theirs, along with
the glory and the groans of overindulgence.

As they sat, immobilized by their triumph, the pain was a stark reminder of
their limits. Yet even as they nursed their swollen bellies, the call of
adventure whispered to them. The Crypt of the Damned beckoned, its secrets
wrapped in the same dark shroud as the mystery of the Gloom itself.

On the road, their appetite, that mythical beast tamed by too many pies, stirred
once more. The sight of green berries by the wayside proved too tantalizing to
ignore. With cautious nibbles, they discovered, much to their relief, that the
fruits were delicious and most importantly, not poisonous. Their bellies, the
size of rolling hills, could not deny the call of the wild berry.

The Crypt of the Damned was a hallowed place of darkness and echoes, inhabited
by a motley crew of bandits and reanimated skeletons clattering about, seeking
the warmth of life to snuff out. Yet even as the adventurers swung their
weapons, their overstuffed midriffs protested with each movement—a comic dance
of battle and belches.

Amidst the chaos, they stumbled upon cultists, their chants rising and falling
in the grim rhythm of a forbidden ritual to bring forth elemental demons. For
Croaky's Waste Management Services, though, slaying foes was as easy as... pie.
The pun hung in the air, as palpable as the aftertaste of their earlier feast.

The aftermath of battle revealed scribblings on an ancient altar, the language
as indecipherable as the reasoning behind a second helping of dessert. Yet
within the tangled glyphs, two clear beacons emerged: the Ruinous Crypt, gripped
by the cult, and the Decaying Crypt, a stronghold of the undead. A choice lay
before them—crush the throng of the undead, and win the cult's favor, or
continue to disrupt their vile schemes.

With the weight of their gastronomic exploits slowing their steps but not their
resolve, Croaky's Waste Management Services readied themselves for the next
chapter in their saga. Whether facing sinister cultists or legions of the
undead, their appetites for adventure—and perhaps a little more pie—remained as
insatiable as ever.
