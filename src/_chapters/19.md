The obsession of Bamboo Bandit had set their course; Croaky's Waste Management
Services
was bound for the Palace of Ice, the frozen monolith where they were to unseal
the Tomb
of Xorn. The trek through the Copperneck Mountains was arduous, a chilling
prelude to
the marvel that awaited them—a palace wrought from ice and crystal that
shimmered like a
jewel under the mountain sun.

As they ventured through the grand corridors, awed by the Savvas architecture
that framed
the icy halls, the Staff of Xorn thrummed with an ancient hunger. A spectral
green mist
crept along the floor, a silent guide leading them deeper into the heart of the
palace.

A confrontation awaited in the halls, with bears that were not merely beasts but
undead,
their eyes void of life and fur matted with remnants of decay. The party faced
this
unnatural threat with their customary valor, dispatching the corrupted creatures
before
pressing onward.

In the palace's central chamber, they found a congregation of Harrower warriors
encircling
a grand altar. The Staff of Xorn resonated with ever-increasing fervor at their
appearance,
its desire palpable in Bamboo Bandit's grip. The party, rallying around her,
distracted
the Harrowers while she wielded the staff with devastating effect, its power
surging with
each fallen enemy.

With a ceremonial finality, Bamboo Bandit positioned the staff atop the altar,
unleashing
its full might. Green energy spiraled into the stone, and a voice thundered, a
proclamation
of ominous intent: "You have returned my power, but I require more—I claim this
body as my
vessel!"

A green light condensed into a single point before striking Bamboo Bandit
squarely in the
chest. Her body crumpled, life extinguishing with tragic swiftness. From her
fallen form,
an infestation of insects emerged, swelling grotesquely into a shape of
nightmares that
spoke with cruel glee: "I am reborn! The plague walks the Earth once more!"

The party stood, horror-stricken, as their companion transformed into the very
incarnation
of cataclysm. Their mission had succeeded, yet at a cost none could have
imagined, and now
they faced a new peril birthed from their own actions.
